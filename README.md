Simple Coding Projects / Problems

I'm not that advanced enough to make huge projects or work on major coding problems, so I decided to work on simple ones.

## Includes:

#### fizzbuzz.py 
- Made a function to do fizzbuzz (If a number is divisible by 3, print "fizz". If by 5, print "buzz". If by 3 and 5, print "fizzbuzz". Else, print the number)
- This was done in python.
